This project will allow you to turn your password into a hash value, and further allow for re-hashing the returned hash up to 255 times.

I decided to create this because I was keen to the idea of hashing a word a certain amount of times, and then using it as a password, but 
I couldn't find any programs that would explicitly rehash my already hashed word for me, so I created this.

This uses a windows header (for clipboard copy functionality), but shouldn't have any dependencies.
